# Wave 'n Smile

[![Wave and Smile Teaser](./preview.gif)](https://cloud-player.io)

Wave 'n Smile is a hackathon project developed at [HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/) and uses
[IPFS](http://ipfs.io) to stream 5 second video snippets. 
Everyone can join the network and becomes part of it. 
Data is distributed over each peer instead of a central server that can collect and trade your data

## Technology
The video is transmitted to all connected peers over IPFS.
Over a pubsub system new files are propagated automatically to all nodes that are registered on it.
